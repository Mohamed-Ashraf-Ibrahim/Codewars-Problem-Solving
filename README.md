## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a record of my training journey on Codewars, focusing on solving kata using JavaScript. By working through these challenges, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities, strengthen my understanding of JavaScript syntax and concepts, and explore different algorithmic techniques.
